I am a Cybersecurity Analyst skilled in tools like Splunk, Wireshark, and Maltego, with a strong foundation in cybersecurity principles. My passion for security began after a personal hacking incident, driving me to continuously learn and master cybersecurity tools.

With a background as an automotive technician, I bring a unique perspective to systems thinking, process optimization, and problem-solving. I now apply these skills to protect digital environments, focusing on data protection and network security.

## Objective

Having completed my BrainStation cybersecurity diploma, I’ve gained experience in risk and vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and creating incident and business continuity plans. I’m enthusiastic about joining a tech team to enhance cybersecurity defenses and welcome opportunities to collaborate or share my work!
